# GulpTest

Test of gulp project with Typescript

The project will have source Typescript files in /src/, which are compiled into Javascript and combined to a single file
which is output in /Release/

Unit tests are created in /Tests/ also using Typescript, which compiles to JS stored in /Release/Tests ?

If the tests pass a nuuget package is created in /Releae/NuGet/ containing the .js file

todo: create a .d.ts output and package into a typing package.
